1: What is a hash table?
ans- A structure that maps keys to values
2: If several elements are competing for the same bucket in the hash table, what is it called?
ans- Collision
3: What is a hash function?
ans- A function that computes the location of the key in the array
4: Which of the following is not a technique to avoid a collision?
ans- Increasing hash table size
5: What is the load factor?
ans-  Average chain length
6: What is simple uniform hashing?
ans- Every element has equal probability of hashing into any of the slots
7: In simple uniform hashing, what is the search complexity?
ans- O(1)
8: In simple chaining, what data structure is appropriate?
ans- Doubly linked list
9: The case in which a key other than the desired one is kept at the identified location is called?
ans- collision
10: What data organization method is used in hash tables?
ans- Linked list
11: The task of generating alternative indices for a node is called?
ans- Collision handling
12: Which of the following is not a collision resolution technique?
ans- hashing
13: In a hash table of size 10, where is element 7 placed?
ans- 7
14: What should be the load factor for separate chaining hashing?
ans- 1
15: Which of the following operations are done in a hash table?
ans- Insert and search
16: Which of the following is identical to that of a separate chaining hash node?
ans- Linked list
17: Which of the following is the hashing function for separate chaining?
ans- H(x)=x mod table size

ans- option d) ?
19: In hash tables, how many traversal of links does a successful search require?
ans- 1+ (?/2)
20: Which of the following is a disadvantage of using separate chaining using linked lists?
ans- It requires many pointers
