1: What will be the position of 5, when a max heap is constructed on the input elements 5, 70, 45, 7, 12, 15, 13, 65, 30, 25?
ans: 5 will be at last lvel

2: In a leftist heap, all the operations should be performed on?
ans:right path

3: What would be the result if the left subtree of the root has a null path length of 1 and the right subtree has a null path length of 2?
ans:violation at the root

4: What happens if the null path length is not updated?
ans:all null path lengths will be 0

5: What is the time taken to delete a minimum element in a leftist heap?
ans:O(log N)

6: In what time can a leftist heap be built?
ans: O(N)

7: ___________ is a self-adjusting version of a leftist heap.
ans:Skew heap

8: The relationship of skew heaps to leftist heaps is analogous to that of?
ans:Splay tree and AVL tree

9: What is the fundamental operation performed in skew heaps?
ans:merging

10: What is the time per operation of merging, insertion and deletion operations in a skew heap?
ans:O(log N)

11: Why would a recursive implementation fail in skew heaps?
ans:lack of stack space

12: When is it appropriate to use direct addressing?
ans: When the universe U of keys is reasonably small

13: What is the time complexity to insert an element into the direct address table?
ans:O(1)

14: What is the advantage of using a dynamic set in direct addressing?
ans:It saves space

15: What is the time complexity to delete an element from the direct address table?
ans:O(1)

16: How is a bit vector better compared to a normal array for implementing the hash table?
